Prepare for interviews with structured questions across Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels.

---

## 🟢 Beginner Level Questions (1–10)

1. **What is Lean Six Sigma?**  
**Answer:** Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that combines Lean principles (waste reduction) and Six Sigma (variation reduction) to improve processes.

2. **What is DMAIC?**  
**Answer:** DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control; a structured framework for process improvement.

3. **What is the role of a Black Belt?**  
**Answer:** A Black Belt leads improvement projects, mentors Green Belts, and implements enterprise-level process improvements.

4. **Difference between Green Belt and Black Belt?**  
**Answer:** Green Belts execute projects and support Black Belts, while Black Belts lead strategic, cross-functional projects.

5. **What are the 8 wastes (TIMWOOD)?**  
**Answer:** Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects.

6. **What is a Kaizen event?**  
**Answer:** A focused, short-term improvement activity aimed at eliminating waste and improving a process.

7. **What is process capability (Cp, Cpk)?**  
**Answer:** Metrics that measure how well a process can meet specification limits.

8. **What is Value Stream Mapping (VSM)?**  
**Answer:** A visual tool to analyze the flow of materials and information through a process.

9. **What is Poka-Yoke?**  
**Answer:** A mistake-proofing technique to prevent errors in a process.

10. **Why is Lean Six Sigma important in business?**  
**Answer:** It reduces waste, improves quality, and delivers measurable business benefits.

## 🟡 Intermediate Level Questions (1–10)

1. **Explain Failure Modes & Effects Analysis (FMEA).**  
**Answer:** FMEA identifies potential failures, their causes, effects, and prioritizes risks for corrective actions.

2. **What is Statistical Process Control (SPC)?**  
**Answer:** A method of using control charts to monitor and control a process over time.

3. **Difference between DMAIC and DMADV?**  
**Answer:** DMAIC improves existing processes; DMADV (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify) is used for new process or product design.

4. **Explain Design of Experiments (DOE).**  
**Answer:** DOE is a structured method to determine cause-effect relationships between factors affecting a process.

5. **How do you calculate process sigma level?**  
**Answer:** Sigma level measures the defects per million opportunities (DPMO) using statistical formulas.

6. **What is a Control Chart?**  
**Answer:** A chart used to track process performance and detect variations beyond control limits.

7. **How do you prioritize projects?**  
**Answer:** Using ROI, impact, feasibility, risk, and alignment with strategic goals.

8. **Explain root cause analysis techniques.**  
**Answer:** Techniques include 5 Whys, Fishbone/Ishikawa diagram, Pareto analysis.

9. **Difference between Qualitative & Quantitative risk analysis?**  
**Answer:** Qualitative assesses likelihood & impact; Quantitative uses numerical analysis to calculate potential outcomes.

10. **What is a Black Belt project charter?**  
**Answer:** A document that defines project scope, objectives, timeline, stakeholders, and expected outcomes.

## 🔴 Advanced Level Questions (1–10)

1. **How do you implement Lean Six Sigma at an enterprise level?**  
**Answer:** Align projects with strategy, deploy trained Belts, use portfolio dashboards, and monitor ROI.

2. **Explain multivariate analysis in Six Sigma.**  
**Answer:** Technique to understand relationships between multiple factors simultaneously affecting a process.

3. **What is Design for Six Sigma (DFSS)?**  
**Answer:** A methodology for designing new products/processes with Six Sigma quality standards from inception.

4. **How do you handle resistance to change?**  
**Answer:** Engage stakeholders, communicate benefits, train teams, use change management strategies.

5. **Explain regression analysis and its use.**  
**Answer:** Statistical method to model relationships between dependent and independent variables for prediction.

6. **What is Process Sigma and its significance?**  
**Answer:** Process Sigma indicates process performance; higher sigma means fewer defects.

7. **How do you ensure sustainability of improvements?**  
**Answer:** Use control plans, monitoring dashboards, training, audits, and continuous improvement cycles.

8. **Explain hypothesis testing in Lean Six Sigma.**  
**Answer:** Used to test assumptions about process improvements using statistical evidence.

9. **How do you manage multiple Black Belt projects simultaneously?**  
**Answer:** Prioritize based on impact, allocate resources, monitor KPIs, and mentor teams effectively.

10. **How do you quantify financial impact of Lean Six Sigma projects?**  
**Answer:** Calculate cost savings, defect reduction, cycle time improvements, productivity gains, and ROI.
